# coding_challenge-11

This coding challenge is all about **working with a designer and building a project for a client as if you just started a development company**. You will have to meet a deadline and finish a website (which you will be able to add to your portfolio) based on the design requirements of the client. A very valuable skill to learn. Let's get started!

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## What is the Challenge?
Here is the story: You just started a freelancing software company: Creative/Inc (original name, I know). You just hired a designer and also got your first client. After meeting with the client, you now have an idea of what they want to build and the designer has sent you some design files in order for you to build the rest of the page. Your challenge is to build the page up using the skills you have learned in the course to get the product finished to the client by the end of the month. Good luck and have fun!  

Ps, a big thank you to my friend Matt from (www.frontendmentor.io) for providing the design files and inspiration for this challenge. 

## Coding Challenge Submissions
The wonderful submissions from some of the Zero-to-Mastery students on the eleventh coding challenge. I have included their Discord handle name so you can talk to them about their submissions!

## The Rules Are:

1. Use the assets in this github repository to finish the client's website so you can make them happy. These are all the files that the designer and the client sent you to finish the website. You will notice that they used HSL color format (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp). 

2. **You have until November 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Discord channel with the following message: "-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"
The bot will listen for the command and will submit the link you provided in the command. Please check that the bot responded with "Thanks for submitting your coding challenge entry!" and then double check the details it provides. We will compile all submissions here at the end of the month.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
